Voice assistants have been paradoxical in the way that they have changed our world today. On one hand, it’s like having your own PA— one that follows you around and takes notes for you all day. On the other hand with modern voice assistants like Alexa, google and Siri, there is this constant threat of listening to information passively even when it is not activated. To eliminate the  aforementioned consequence and understand the working of these artificially intelligent voice assistants, this project aims to develop a virtual assistant based on Python, which is I’ll only be activated and deactivated using voice commands. This assistant derives its operational bases from AI and NLP techniques to perform tasks orated by the users. 

The main aim of this project is to create a completely hands-free user experience . It makes a user-device interaction much more intuitive and efficient, since it purely relies on speech to text translations to complete tasks. The basic functionalities of this voice assistant include: opening websites, setting reminders, playing songs, cryptocurrency information, translation from one language to another, top three news headlines and weather predictions for the day. The project aims to contribute towards the development of more natural and intuitive voice-based virtual assistants that can assist users with daily tasks efficiently and effectively. 

# Working: 
To execute the given Jupyter Notebook: 
Install the following depencies by copying and pasting the following code in your terminal:

```
pip install speech_recognition gtts playsound yfinance wolframalpha translators time wikipedia datetime
```

# Conclusion: 
This project successfully implements an AI-based virtual assistant that can perform a plethora of tasks including calendar event setting, memos, reminders, weather prediction and more. This utilizes easily applicable technologies to create something that is spohiscated and allows hands-free operation of a computer device. This demonstrates that AI can be used to automate day-to-day tasks of users, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and efficiency.
